MongoDB -Aggregation Exercises

Import the zips.json file into your MongoDB. Database name is "population" and collection name is "zipcodes".
mongoimport --db population --collection zipcodes --file zips.json

Atlanta Population

1. use db.zipcodes.find() to filter results to only the results where city is ATLANTA and state is GA.
db.zipcodes.find ({$and:[{city:”ATLANTA”},{state:”GA”}]})
2. use db.zipcodes.aggregate with $match to do the same as above.
db.zipcodes.aggregate ([{$match:{city:”ATLANTA”,state:”GA”}}])
3. use $group to count the number of zip codes in Atlanta.
db.zipcodes.aggregate ([{$group:_id:”ATLANTA”,count:{$sum:1}}])
4. use $group to find the total population in Atlanta.
                   In aggregation tab (Compass)select
              $group
             {
            _id: “ATLANTA”,
            Total: {
            $sum: “$pop”
              }
            }


Populations By State

1. use aggregate to calculate the total population for each state
$group
{
_id: “$state”,
Total: {
$sum: “$pop”
}
}
2. sort the results by population, highest first
$sort
{
pop: -1
}
3. limit the results to just the first 3 results. What are the top 3 states in population?
$sort
{
pop: -1
}
Add the stage
In next stage
Limit 3

Populations by City

1. use aggregate to calculate the total population for each city (you have to use city/state combination). You can use a combination for the _id of the $group: { city: '$city', state: '$state' }
$group
{
_id: {
City: “$city”,
State: “$state”
},
Total: {
$sum: “$pop”
}
}
2. sort the results by population, highest first
$sort
{
Total: -1
}
Save the stage
In the next stage select limit
Limit 3
3. limit the results to just the first 3 results. What are the top 3 cities in population?
{
Total: -1
}
Save and in the next stage select limit and enter 3 as limit
3
4. What are the top 3 cities in population in Texas?
$group
{
_id: {city: “$city”,
State: “$Texas”},
$sum: “$pop”
}
}
Add the stage
In the next stage
$sort
{
Total: -1
}
Add the stage
In the next stage select limit
$limit 
3


Bonus

1. Write a query to get the average city population for each state.
$group
{
_id: {city: “$city”,
State: “$state”},
Avgpop: {
$avg: “$pop”
}
}
2. What are the top 3 states in terms of average city population?
$group
{
_id: {city: “$city”,
State: “$state”},
Avg: {
$avg: “$pop”
}
}
$sort
{
Avgpop: -1
}
Add and select limit in next stage
$limit
3
